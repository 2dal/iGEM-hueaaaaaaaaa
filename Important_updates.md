30.06:  
Added use of IGEM site paragraph in readme.  
All references should now use full url, and direct to the files at the IGEM server,  
this goes both for src in the ````<img>```` tag, and href in ```<a>``` tags, amongst any other references.
Development page is no longer supported, progress may only be tracked on live site
